# spotify-scrape-model

This is a simple script for scraping "Liked" songs from a user's spotify. It then scrapes a different spotify playlist and then fits several models on the data to predict whether a user will like the song or not.

The user needs to generate a config file on the Spotify developers site in order to access the Spotifz API
